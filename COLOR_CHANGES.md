   - Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) can be too bright and harsh
   - Replaced with `gray-50` (`#f9fafb`) - a soft, warm light gray
   - Easier on the eyes, more professional appearance

2. **Enhanced Brand Colors:**
   - Your red colors (`#a50102`, `#990100`) now stand out more
   - Better contrast between backgrounds and brand elements
   - Red is used strategically for emphasis (buttons, headers, accents)

3. **Improved Visual Hierarchy:**
   - Primary red: Headers, main navigation, key sections
   - Accent blue: Call-to-action buttons (Book Now, Sign Up)
   - Light gray: Content backgrounds
   - Dark gray: Footer, contrast sections

4. **Better User Experience:**
   - Softer backgrounds reduce eye strain
   - High contrast maintained for readability
   - Brand colors used purposefully, not overwhelming
